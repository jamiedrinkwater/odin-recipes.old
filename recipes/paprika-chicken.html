    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The great blend of spices on these broiled chicken breasts has a wonderful flavor and pairs well with many vegetable side dishes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>something else</li>
        <li>something else</li>
        <li>many other things</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease a broiler pan with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Brush with remaining olive oil until coated. Sprinkle each piece evenly on both sides with paprika, lemon-pepper, and salt. Place on the prepared broiler pan, sprinkle garlic over top, and sprinkle onions around the base of the chicken, with several smaller pieces on top.</li>
        <li>Cook under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, checking often, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
